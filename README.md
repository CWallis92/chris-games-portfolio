# Portfolio: Board Games Reviews 'Forum'

Hi! This is an app I've put together to collect reviews of board games. You can add new users, post new reviews, add comments to those reviews, and up/down-vote those reviews and comments.

## Hosted version

A public version of the API is available [here](https://chris-nc-games.herokuapp.com/api).
